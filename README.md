# Classification-of-Edible-and-Poisonous-Mushrooms 
## Making and Tuning a Model for Production
**Guy Lozius**:

### Business problem:
The goal is to create a model that is efficient at determining if a mushroom is edible or poisonous, and then recommend it for production and the stakeholder. <br/>
### Data:
Dataset source: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification)<br/>
Dataset Description:<br/>
The dataset is made of synthetic samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom. Each species is either edible or poisonous.<br/>

### Methods:
- Clean data
- Simply exploratory  
- Visual exploratory 
- Create models
- Baseline evaluation 
- Implement Principal component analysis  to increase speed 
- Re-evaluation   
- Tune Models
- Re-evaluation  
- Compare models
- Recommend the best 
-Justify recommendation 
## Results
### Trends 
![class_odor](class_odor.png)
Bad and spicy smelling mushroom tend to be poisonous.

![color](color.png)
Buff, yellow, pink, and red have a higher chance of being Poisonous.<br/>
## Info on Final Model
The model I picked for "production" is a LogisticRegression for classification of poisonous and edible mushrooms <br/>
and that was hyperparameter tuned and preprocessed with the Principal Component Analysis algorithm to increase performance.
## The model Recommendation.
The model it is fastest and it can determine if a mushroom is edible or poisonous with 100% precision.
The only problem is that dataset is made with synthetic mushroom base on average, so I do not know how it will fare against real mushrooms.
## Conclusion
In Conclusion, The goal is to make the optimal model to determine if a mushroom is poisonous  or edible based on a synthetic mushroom dataset. The final model was fastest and had accuracy of hundred percent, but because the dataset is based on a hypothetical  dataset. I can not fully support putting it in production because I donâ€™t know how it will fare with real mushrooms.
