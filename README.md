# Classification-of-Edible-and-Poisonous-Mushrooms
## The model Recommendation 
The model I picked for "production" is  LogisticRegression for classification of poisonous and edible mushroom because it is fastest and with high accuracy, but the dataset is made with synthetic mushroom base on average, which can lead to data leakage causing all models to have high accuracy, so I will not recommend any model for production.
